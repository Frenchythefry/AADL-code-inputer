It will put in AADL codes faster than manually.


(This program is designed for Edge and Chrome. If you are using another web browser like Chromium or Firefox, this might not work.)

1. Go into Command Prompt* and type in the following command:
"pip install pynput"

2. Go into your web browser, and open a spreadsheet in one tab and the AADL code input screen in the other. Make sure that these are the only 2 tabs open. The spreadsheet has to have all of the codes in a collum.

3. Select the first code at the top, and also make sure the box to input codes is selected.

4. Now you are ready to start the program. Start it in any python ide that you want to, such as VSC.

5. It will ask you how many codes you have. Type in a few more than this number to make sure they are all typed in.

6. Now you will have 5 seconds to get into the spreadsheet. Once the 5 seconds is up, the program will start inputting codes.


I hope you enjoy this program. If you have any feedback, submit feedback on the Github Repo.
